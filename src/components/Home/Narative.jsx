              Because serious investors look for a strong narrative before
              buying in, right? ​ Well, here you go! ​ Brett is pepe's college
              roommate and best friend. Once humid, summer morning and desperate
              for some relief from the hot sun, Brett made his way to the public
              pool to take a dip.

              He found himself alone there... alone and, as usual, horny. So he
              did what he usually does. The kid introduced himself as brett's
              long lost son, Bratt. Brett was confused. Bratt told him the story
              of what happened. Brett became even more confused. ​ They found
              some difficulties dealing with each other at first, but
              ultimately, blood proved thicker than water. They resolved their
              issues and have come to accept each other for who they truly
              are... ​ Father and son
            </p>

              He jerked off. ​ The bastard jerked off and left his jizz floating
              on the pool! A fucking public pool! ​ Soon after he left, a poor
              lass entered the pool, did some breast strokes, some backstrokes,
              and to her regret later on, some frog strokes. It was during the
              latter when Brett's mini-me's found their way into the unlucky
              woman... ​ And that was that. ​ Years later and Pepe has become a
              cultural icon, rubbing off some of his popularity on Brett who has
              become a big name himself owing to his own Crypto token which
              breached 300 million USD in market cap on the base chain network.
              ​ Brett was surprised by the sudden visit of a weird, spiky-haired
              kid who also had an earring.
